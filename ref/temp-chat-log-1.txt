What I see here is what you've on the landing page? Do you see theb problems with this?[Image 
  #1] The problems still persists, 
    the design flaws are still there. The number have a weird box behind them which are not 
  appropriately designed and sized 
    according to the numbers, the hero section still has the weird border, the image you resized 
  has the text in it which doesn't 
    hvave left and rught margins, the third section with use cases have written examples which 
  doesn't look pleasing, but don't 
    worry I've give you screenshots of different usecases that you can use instead. The see in 
  action section needs a better example
     with a proper paragraph for before and after. The quick installation section has a weird 
  inconsistent line going through the 
    numbers, and the last section of how to use hve text inconsistency and placement errors, no 
  spacing, etc. Overall we need to fix
     a lot of major problems or else this wouldn't work for us.[Image #2] Let me know if you are 
  updated with what we are doing with our landing page and if you understand what we are trying to
   fix.
